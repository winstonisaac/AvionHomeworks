Winning a record four NBA All-Star Game MVP awards, he was the overall league MVP in 2008, a two-time NBA scoring champion and 12 All-Defensive selections. He teamed with Shaquille O’Neal in a combustible partnership to lead the Lakers to NBA titles in 2000, 2001 and 2002. He later teamed with Pau Gasol to win two more titles in 2009 and 2010.

                    <p>Dear Basketball,<br>From the moment<br>I started rolling my dad’s tube socks<br>And shooting imaginary<br>Game-winning shots<br>In the Great Western Forum<br>I knew one thing was real:<br>I fell in love with you.<br>A love so deep I gave you my all —<br>From my mind & body<br>To my spirit & soul.<br>As a six-year-old boy<br>Deeply in love with you<br>I never saw the end of the tunnel.<br>I only saw myself<br>Running out of one.<br>And so I ran.<br>I ran up and down every court<br>After every loose ball for you.<br>You asked for my hustle<br>I gave you my heart<br>Because it came with so much more.<br>I played through the sweat and hurt<br>Not because challenge called me<br>But because YOU called me.<br>I did everything for YOU<br>Because that’s what you do<br>When someone makes you feel as<br>Alive as you’ve made me feel.<br>You gave a six-year-old boy his Laker dream<br>And I’ll always love you for it.<br>But I can’t love you obsessively for much longer.<br>This season is all I have left to give.<br>My heart can take the pounding<br>My mind can handle the grind<br>But my body knows it’s time to say goodbye.<br>And that’s OK.<br>I’m ready to let you go.<br>I want you to know now<br>So we both can savor every moment we have left together.<br>The good and the bad.<br>We have given each other<br>All that we have.<br>And we both know, no matter what I do next<br>I’ll always be that kid<br>With the rolled up socks<br>Garbage can in the corner<br>:05 seconds on the clock<br>Ball in my hands.<br>5 … 4 … 3 … 2 … 1<br>Love you always,<br>Kobe</p>
